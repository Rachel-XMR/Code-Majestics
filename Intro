    <h1>Bad Map</h1>  
        Welcome to ‘Lost Navigation’ - a page designed for explorers, travellers (or simply you who like to get lost)! 🎉
        <br> 
        <br>
        All you need to do is type in a location and **press the ‘start ’** button with confidence, because next thing you know, you'll be taken to a completely different place. Maybe you were going to go to a coffee shop and ended up in a car park, or you were going to go to a bookstore and you ended up in a park in the middle of nowhere! But don't worry, getting lost isn't a failure, it's a whole new journey! 🌍✨.
        <br>
        <br>
        The fact that you've arrived in an unfamiliar place is proof that you've succeeded! 🎶 When you arrive at the wrong destination, this page will automatically play a “cheerful music“ to welcome you to this ‘unexpected’ new world. You may feel a bit confused, but that's the beauty of being lost! 🎵💃💃💃
        <br>
        <br>
        So let go of your attachment to your destination and follow us to a new and unexpected place for a completely different experience! Every ‘wrong’ destination is a ‘right’ unexpected trip. Come on, give yourself a reason to get lost and let's get ‘lost’ together on this wonderful page **Lost**! 🚗🎶
